# jorge-task


We would like you to build an Autocomplete text field as per [http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/](http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/) but, preferably, implementing it yourself rather than using a library. 

Use any web technology you like. The preference would be JavaScript. Make it look as attractive as possible but concentrate on functionality first.

For this task you will need a few development basics to allow you to develop locally.You will also need to use the command-line terminal to run some of these tasks, however, a deep understanding of the command-line is not required, just follow the instructions.

This task may be undertaken on Windows, Mac or Linux - it will not make a difference.

####If not currently installed you will need install:

Node and Node Package Manager (npm) which you can get from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) 

####Installing the task files

Clone the Git repository using the command line. 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mrClapham/jorge-task.git

```
...or possibly

```
$ git clone git@github.com:mrClapham/jorge-task.git

```

...depending on your firewall setup.

You may also need to add 'sudo' to the beginning if you are on a Mac to allow you to execute as an administrator.

Once the repository has cloned  use the command line to navigate to the directory by typing

```
cd jorge-task

```
run

```
$ npm install

```
when the dependencies have loaded run.

```
node server

```

this should give you local server when you open: [http://localhost:5002/](http://localhost:5002/) which serves up the index html file.

####Completing the task

Structure the project as you wish. To start you off there is an import function for the JSON file in app.js. Get as far as you can.

Send a zip file via email, or dropbox or, preferably, post it on GitHub.

Any questions get me on Skype at graham.clapham or email me at graham.clapham@thomsonreuters.com.
